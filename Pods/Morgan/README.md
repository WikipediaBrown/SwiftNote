A travel companion for your apps, a solitaire friend for **[Walker](https://github.com/RamonGilabert/Walker)**. This library aims to make the job of using day to day animations easier, just with one line of code you are going to be able to do delightful animations.

Note that **Morgan** is never finished, as I find more and more cases and animations in my daily iOS life, I'll keep adding them here, making the biggest set of animations in iOS, and I would be happy if you help me on that too.

## Code

**Morgan** uses **[Walker](https://github.com/RamonGilabert/Walker)** as the animation engine and works tight with him to provide you with a set of different animations, let me list you a few of them.

```swift
view.fall()
view.zoom()
view.levitate()
view.flip()
view.swing()
view.morph()
view.shake()
view.peek()
view.zoom()
view.slide()
view.disappear()
```

To check the rest of the animations available check the [source files](https://github.com/RamonGilabert/Morgan/tree/master/Sources).

## Installation

**Morgan** is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Morgan'
```

**Morgan** is also available through [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). To install just write into your Cartfile:

```ruby
github 'RamonGilabert/Morgan'
```

## Upcoming features

As stated above, **Morgan** is always in motion, always changing, growing and improving, there's no roadmap, just a set of new PR every time I, or someone else finds something interesting to share with the community.
